  * what are business chalenges that are being prevented?
  * what are tasks/goals?

1. gain perspective
    * what, who, why, when, how
      * user interviews
      * > history lessons
      * mapping people
      * mapping processes
        * watch what they're actually doing

      * mapping information
        * papare, email, skype?
      * mapping technologies
        * (excel connected directly to db??)
      * cataloging technologies
    * ~ 3 months...
2. get plan
    * strategies
      * rewrite / plug in existing
      * start at edges
      * start at head or tail?  limit what can break
    * define boundaries
      * initial boundaries will be wrong
      * org chart boundaries
        * conway's law
      * define org boundaries as the Should be
        * be careful eliminatingn departments!

      * internal organisations - functional or business
      * value streams?
    * where to start?
      * risk vs value
      * people risk
      * technology risk
        * what if MF lives on for another year
    * project and scope risk
    * single source of truth
    * disable functionality
3. pilot program
    * running system and app - that still works, but not necessarily all bells and whistles
    * dedicated team
    * destroying silos
      * one single team to ensure success
    * what are we building?
      * self contained system?
      * composite UI?
    * navel-gazing and bike-shedding
      * choosing a technology, eg, [noun].js
    * team training
    * constrain scope
    * constrain goals
    * complete solution (enough that it evaluates all reqs)
4. phased migration
    * next service?
    * staging teams
    * measuring progress - how much is left?  13,000 story points

* final lessons
  * people over technology
  * compassion over disdain
  * product over project
  * no silver bullets
